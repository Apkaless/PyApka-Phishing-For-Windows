## Repository Overview

Welcome to the repository! This project leverages Python Playwright to control a Chromium browser. Please ensure you have all necessary dependencies installed and follow the instructions below to set up the environment correctly.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **pip** (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Apkaless/PyApka-Phishing-For-Windows.git
    cd PyApka-Phishing-For-Windows
    ```

2. **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Setting Up Chromium

This repository requires a Chromium browser to be controlled by Playwright. The `chromewin` folder, which should contain the Chromium browser, is missing. You need to download the browser using the Playwright Python library.

### Steps to Download Chromium Browser

1. **Download the necessary browser binaries:**
    ```sh
    python -m playwright install chromium
    ```

This command will download the Chromium browser and place it in the appropriate directory managed by Playwright.
