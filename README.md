## Repository Overview

Welcome to the repository! This project leverages Python Playwright to control a Chromium browser. Please ensure you have all necessary dependencies installed and follow the instructions below to set up the environment correctly.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **pip** (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Apkaless/PyApka-Phishing-For-Windows.git
    cd PyApka-Phishing-For-Windows
    ```

2. **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Setting Up Chromium

This repository requires a Chromium browser to be controlled by Playwright. The `chromewin` folder, which should contain the Chromium browser, is missing. You need to download the browser using the Playwright Python library.

### Steps to Download Chromium Browser

1. **Install Playwright:**
    ```sh
    pip install playwright
    ```

2. **Download the necessary browser binaries:**
    ```sh
    python -m playwright install chromium
    ```

This command will download the Chromium browser and place it in the appropriate directory managed by Playwright.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can run the Python scripts that use Playwright to control the Chromium browser. Make sure your scripts are configured to reference the correct browser path if necessary.
